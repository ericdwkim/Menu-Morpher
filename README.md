## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericdwkim/Menu-Morpher.git
cd Menu-Morpher
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

You can set up your development environment using either `venv` (recommended for pure Python) or `Conda` (useful if you are managing dependencies that include non-Python packages).

### Using venv

If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, you can install it first:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Using conda

Create and activate a Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name menumorpher python=3.8
conda activate menumorpher
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
