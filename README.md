## Description

Menu Morpher is a Python client for the Google My Business API focused on updating and downloading business menus. This tool allows businesses to easily manage and transform their menu data programmatically. No more hassle in finding your `account_id`, `location_id`, and reading Google API documentation! 

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Completed the [Prerequisites - Google Business Profile APIs](https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/prereqs)
- Have your `project_id` handy
- [OAuth2.0 credentials](https://developers.google.com/my-business/content/basic-setup#request-client-id) requested, created, and [consented](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent?project={your_project_id_here})
- Enabled the following (3) APIs via `APIs & Services` through Google Cloud Console (GCC)

NOTE: To use the following hyperlinks, replace `{your_project_id_here}` with your _actual_ `project_id`:

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericdwkim/Menu-Morpher.git
cd Menu-Morpher
```

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

You can set up your development environment using either `venv` (recommended for pure Python) or `Conda` (useful if you are managing dependencies that include non-Python packages).

### Using venv

If you don't have `virtualenv` installed, you can install it first:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### Using conda

Create and activate a Conda environment:

```bash
conda create --name menumorpher python=3.8
conda activate menumorpher
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Morph My Menus!

### Step 1: Download your menus locally

This calls the `getFoodMenus` API and saves your menus locally as `menu.json` within your root projct directory
```python
python -m app.__main__ --download
```

### Step 2: Check that your location can update menus

This calls the `get_canHaveFoodMenus` method and will inform you via console logs whether your location can update menus or not. `canHaveFoodMenus_flag` must yield `True`.

```python
python -m app.__main__ --check
```
### Step 3: Make the menu changes
Make the necessary changes to your `menu.json`

### Step 4: Update your menus
This calls the `updateFoodMenus` API and makes the PATCH request to ~~update~~ morph your menus completely!
```python
python -m app.__main__ --update
```
